Revision history for Fedora-App-MaintainerTools

0.006 Wed Mar 10 2010
- we can now build new specs/srpms recursively!  (And display them as a dep
  tree.)
- Initial changes required to enable fully-managed spec mode have been
  committed, along with a "helper" command to make breaking out the custom
  sections (to auto.ini) easier.

0.005 Mon Mar  8 2010
- Use '%{summary}.' as the default description
- "Suspect requires" are now filtered from the requires stream, and included
  as BR's if not already present.  (e.g. Test::More and the like).
- properly increment release when we're a revision
- We now have bits to invoke the RPM metadata filtering system.  This can be
  done on an override basis (e.g. in auto.ini) as well as by examining the
  "no_index" parts in META.yml.
- We now log actual version++'s in the %changelog when updating to a new GA.
- We now try to get %docfile right.
- We always check to ensure EU::MM is BR'ed.

0.004 Tue Feb 23 2010
- various cleanups related to excising the last of the old "plugins" system
- better rpm/srpm building
- write specs to files, not just stdout
- add a "run for additional deps" option (see, e.g., find_optional_deps in
  perl-Moose/devel)

0.003 Wed Feb 17 2010
- rework plugins system -- role based (and makes sense) now
- first shot at SRPM generation code

0.002 Tue Feb 16 2010

0.001 Wed Jun 17 2009
