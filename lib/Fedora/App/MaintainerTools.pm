=head1 NAME

Fedora::App::MaintainerTools - Main application class

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is the main application class for MaintainerTools; we don't do much
except extend L<MooseX::App::Cmd> as required.

More extensive documentation should be available as part of the man page
for the command line app, L<maintainertool>.

=head1 SEE ALSO

L<maintainertool>

=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

This is still a VERY early release; while I don't believe it'll eat any of
your files, if it does, you get to keep both pieces :)

Please report problems to Chris Weyl <cweyl@alumni.drew.edu>, or (preferred)
to this package's RT tracker at E<bug-Fedora-App-MaintainerTools@rt.cpan.org>.

Patches are welcome.
