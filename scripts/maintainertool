=head1 NAME

maintainertool - Common tasks a Fedora maintainer may need to undertake


=head1 SYNOPSIS

    maintainertool updatespec perl-Foo.spec

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<WARNING: This is *VERY* early code.  While it's not likely to, if it breaks
something, you're entitled to all the pieces.>

The maintainertool automates certain common tasks the maintainer of Fedora
Perl packages may do.  Right now, we only support updating spec files with
new versions and metadata from the CPAN; we're even pretty restrictive there.

This is a very early release.

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

We log most things to stderr; on unexpected situations weird errors may be
generated.

=head1 CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT

TODO.

=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

There are no known bugs in this module; but like any reasonably complex system
there are undoubtedly any.

Please report problems to Chris Weyl <cweyl@alumni.drew.edu>, or (preferred) 
to this package's RT tracker at <bug-Fedora-App-MaintainerTools@rt.cpan.org>.

Patches are welcome.
